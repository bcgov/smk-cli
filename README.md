# Simple Map Kit Command-line Interface

A command line utility and visual editor for creating and editing [Simple Map Kit](https://github.com/bcgov/smk) applications.

# Documentation

Check out the SMK CLI documentation available [here](https://bcgov.github.io/smk-cli/)

# Installation

The SMK CLI can be installed via NPM in two different ways;
either local to the current project, or globally for your whole system.

## Global installation

To install the command globally, so it can be used from any project in our system, use this command:

    npm install -global smk-cli

This may require you to use administrative rights (or `sudo`) on your machine, depending on how it is configured.

Test that installation was successful by executing:

    smk help

## Local installation

To install the command local to a particular project, first change into the directory of the project:

    cd <project>
    npm install --save-dev smk-cli

The `smk` will be installed for that particular project, as a dev dependency.
Test that installation was successful by executing:

    node_modules/.bin/smk help

# Commands

    smk create [name]

This will launch the command line tool for creating a new SMK application.
You can provide a name, it will be the name of the new subdirectory for the application.
This will download the latest version of SMK from GitHub and build a map configuration for you to start working with.

    smk edit [-p port]

Once you've created an SMK application, or if you have an existing one, you can run this command to launch the visual editor.
