# Installing the SMK-CLI

[Check your dependencies!](getting-started.md)

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine you're ready to download and install the SMK-CLI. Simply type the following into your command line of choice:

```bash
npm install —global smk-cli
```

If you prefer to install a specific version, you can check NPM for the available version list in the [NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smk-cli/)

then append the version tag on your install command:

```bash
npm install —global smk-cli@1.0.0-beta.6
```

NPM should now install all required packages as a globally accessible command line utility. You're ready to get started!
