# Simple Map Kit Command Line Utility (SMK-CLI)

![logo](smk-logo.png)

The SMK-CLI is a utility for assisiting with the creation, modification and development of Simple Map Kit projects. If you're here, but don't know what SMK is, it's highly recommended you [check it out first.](https://bcgov.github.io/smk/)

Please note that the SMK-CLI is primarily a developer tool. While it's perfectly usable by anyone without development knowledge or experience (you don't have to play with code if you don't want to), this tool (and therefore this documentation) is geared to individuals who have a working understanding of javascript development in a node.js environment.

## Contents

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Creating an SMK application with the CLI](create-an-app.md)
- [Editing an SMK application with the CLI](edit-an-app.md)

## For the future

A web/electron based editor that is independent of Node?

## Special Thanks

Gov BC, Vivid, put some logos here for fucks sake
