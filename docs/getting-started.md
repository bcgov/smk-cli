# Getting Started

## SMK and SMK-CLI repositories

Firstly, lets get acquainted with SMK and the SMK-CLI. Some useful links for various components of the SMK Project

- [SMK repo](https://github.com/bcgov/smk)
- [SMK NPM repo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smk)
- [SMK-CLI repo](https://github.com/bcgov/smk-cli)
- [SMK-CLI NPM repo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smk-cli)

Please review the SMK documentation prior to using the SMK-CLI. All SMK repositories are currently hosted on GitHub and are completely open-source.

## SMK-CLI Dependencies

The first step in getting started with the SMK-CLI is installation of dependencies. SMK-CLI is installed as an npm global package so you'll need to have node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Node.js is a free, open source server environment that runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.), for running JavaScript on a server based environment.

NPM is a package manager for Node.js applications and is installed along side Node.js.

These tools are needed to install and run the SMK-CLI and build your final SMK project for local testing.

You can find downloads for installation of these dependencies at [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You will need to ensure you've installed Node.js v12.x or higher
